<p> Welcome to the site of Matthew Nguyen! <p>

<p>I'm currently a Masters student at North Carolina State University pursuing a Masters of Computer Science and have put together this portfolio site to show off some of my projects as well as to write blog posts and life updates! I have dabbled in projects such as game dev, fullstack, and devops CI/CD but am always looking to expand my experience with more and more interesting projects for the future. <p>
